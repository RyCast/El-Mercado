        <h1>Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.<br>General Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <div class="version">V1.2 • Effective 1/29/2025</div>
    </header>

    <p>These terms and conditions (“General T&Cs”) shall govern the services performed and the products provided by <strong>Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.</strong> (“Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.”) to the extent referenced by a proposal, quote, inspection report, order form, rider, invoice, or other document or otherwise incorporated into an agreement (each an “Order Document”). Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall perform the services on behalf of the customer listed in the Order Document (the “Customer”). Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. and Customer are each a “Party” and collectively are the “Parties”. The Order Document shall describe the services to be performed and/or products to be provided under that Order Document (the “Work”). The service specific terms attached hereto as Exhibit A shall apply if, and only if, that service is included in the Work or as otherwise indicated. Work may be subject to additional Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. provided supplemental terms that are incorporated into the Order Document (the “Supplemental Terms”). The Supplemental Terms shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, the General T&Cs. The General T&Cs and the Order Document are the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the Work under that Order Document (the “Agreement”). Given the nature of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s services, the Work may require terms that differ from the General T&Cs. Any such differences shall be set forth in the Order Document, the terms of which shall control over any conflicting terms contained in the General T&Cs.</p>

    <div class="warning">
        CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS EXCULPATORY, INDEMNITY, INSURANCE, MANDATORY ARBITRATION, AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CUSTOMER’S ABILITY TO BRING A CLAIM UNDER THE AGREEMENT. SOME OF THESE LIMITATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, IN WHICH CASE THEY MAY NOT APPLY.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Term and Termination</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated in the Order Document, the term of the Agreement (the “Term”) shall be as follows. The Agreement shall begin on the earlier of (i) the date the Order Document is fully executed and (ii) the date Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. begins the Work (the “Effective Date”). For one-time Work, such as installations, the Term shall expire upon the completion of the Work. For recurring Work, the initial term shall expire on the date set forth in the Order Document, which shall automatically renew for successive periods equal to the initial term (collectively the initial term and all renewal terms are the Term), unless a Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent not to renew at least thirty days prior to the end of the then current Term. Either Party may terminate the Agreement for cause if the other Party materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty days of receiving written notice of the breach. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may terminate the Agreement for convenience upon thirty days written notice. If the Agreement is terminated before the completion of the Work, Customer shall (i) pay Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for the portion of the Work performed as of the date of termination; (ii) reimburse Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for costs incurred in anticipation of the provision of the remaining Work, such as the cost of materials procured but not installed as of the date of termination; (iii) reimburse Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for costs incurred by reason of the termination, including costs attributable to termination of subcontracts or vendor agreements; and (iv) unless terminated by Customer for cause or Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for convenience, pay Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. the portion of the remaining fee attributed to overhead and profit with respect to Work not yet performed as of the date of termination.</p>

    <h2>2. Performance of the Work</h2>
    <p>Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall only be responsible for performing the Work with respect to the systems and equipment expressly listed in the Order Document (the “Covered Systems”). Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall perform all Work during its normal working hours and days, as determined in the sole discretion of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. will perform the Work in a workmanlike manner, and, in doing so, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may take all actions it deems necessary to provide the Work, including drilling holes, driving nails, and making attachments. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall not be responsible for any condition reasonably created as a result of the Work. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. reserves the right to modify materials, parts, and equipment, including substituting materials, parts, and equipment of later design, provided that such modifications or substitutions will not materially and negatively impact performance. Customer assumes the risk of loss for materials, parts, and equipment once delivered to the Facilities. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may engage third parties to provide all or a portion of the Work (“Subcontractors”), and the terms of the Agreement shall apply to and inure to the benefit of such Subcontractors. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of the Subcontractors to the same extent that it is responsible for the acts or omissions of its own employees. Customer acknowledges that (i) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. has explained the full range of services, equipment, and protection available to Customer; (ii) additional protection over and above that provided in the Work is available and may be obtained at an additional cost; and (iii) Customer desires and has contracted for only the Work and Covered Systems expressly described in the Agreement.</p>

    <h2>3. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Customer acknowledges that it has superior knowledge of its buildings, infrastructure, property, equipment, and systems, whether owned or leased by Customer, that are related to the Work (the “Facilities”). To the extent relevant to the Work, Customer shall provide Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. with complete written documentation of such Facilities and the layout, configuration, inspection, testing, and maintenance history of the Covered Systems. In addition, Customer agrees and warrants that it will (i) provide a safe working environment while Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is at the Facilities; (ii) provide utilities deemed necessary by Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., including electric, heat, and an adequate water supply; (iii) keep accurate and current work logs and information about the Covered Systems as recommended by the manufacturer and/or Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.; (iv) provide an adequate environment for Covered Systems as recommended by the manufacturer and/or Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., including adequate space, electrical power, water supply, air conditioning, and humidity control; (v) notify Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. as soon as possible of any suspected or confirmed inadequacy, failure, or other condition materially affecting the operation of the Covered Systems; (vi) operate the Covered Systems according to the manufacturer’s and/or Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s recommendations; (vii) provide Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. with unobstructed access to the Facilities and the Covered Systems, to the extent necessary for the performance of the Work; (viii) obtain all necessary licenses and permits; (ix) appropriately maintain the proper operation of any system, equipment, or device connected or attached to the Covered Systems; and (x) not tamper with, alter, adjust, disturb, injure, remove, or otherwise interfere with the Covered Systems and prevent others from doing the same. The Agreement assumes that, unless expressly acknowledged in the Order Document, any existing Facilities and Covered Systems are in operational and maintainable condition as of the Effective Date. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not responsible for loss or damage due to the character, condition, or use of foundations, walls, or other structures not erected by Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., or for damage resulting from concealed piping, wiring, fixtures, or other equipment, or the condition of water pressure. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. has no responsibility or liability for shutting off utilities or equipment. If the Work requires that any utilities or equipment are disconnected or shut off, Customer is responsible for engaging a licensed professional, independent of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., to provide the necessary services within 48-hours of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s request. In the event of an emergency or system failure with respect to the Covered Systems, Customer will take reasonable safety precautions to protect life and property. Customer shall provide all necessary information pertaining to events leading up to the emergency or failure, including but not limited to time logs and emergency response personnel records. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it bears the sole risk for any loss, injury, or damages resulting from or related to the inaccuracy of representations or information provided by Customer or Customer’s failure to comply with this section. In addition, if Customer breaches any of these obligations, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall have the right, upon written notice to Customer, to suspend the Work until Customer cures such breach, and Customer shall reimburse Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for any costs that Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. reasonably incurs in connection with such breach. Unless expressly noted in the Order Document, the Work is not intended to comply with specific federal, state, or local building, fire, occupancy, life safety or other codes. It is the Customer’s responsibility to notify Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. of all codes and legal or regulatory requirements relevant to the Work.</p>

    <h2>4. Financial Terms</h2>
    <p>In consideration of the Work, Customer shall pay Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. the amounts set forth in the Order Document. In the event Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s costs increase, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may reasonably increase its fees for any Work not yet performed to offset such increased costs, upon written notice to Customer. For recurring Work, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may increase the on-going fee for the remainder of the Term, but no more frequently than once during any 12-month period, and such increase shall not exceed 20% of the then current rates. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall send Customer an invoice for the Work before the Work is performed, and Customer shall pay such invoice within 30 days of the invoice date. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may require full payment at or before the time the Work is performed. Where applicable, Customer agrees to allow Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. to collect and review Customer’s credit information solely for purposes of determining credit terms. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. reserves the right to extend, change, or terminate any credit status at its sole discretion. If payment is not received by the due date, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may pursue any of the following options, in addition to any rights available under the Agreement or applicable law (i) suspend the provision of the Work and/or any other services being provided to Customer outside of the Agreement; (ii) assess interest at the maximum rate allowed by law; (iii) require that all subsequent invoices are immediately due and payable, and/or; (iv) terminate any and all agreements between Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. and Customer, or a portion thereof. Customer shall reimburse Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for any costs it sustains in pursuit of past due payments, including reasonable legal fees and agency commissions. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s acceptance of less than full payment or failure to pursue any of the options available under the Agreement, shall not be a waiver of any of its rights. Title to Covered Systems shall transfer to Customer once installed; however, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall retain a security interest in such Covered Systems until it is fully paid. Customer agrees to pay all taxes, permits, and license fees, however designated or levied.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes</h2>
    <p>Changes, alterations, or additions to the Agreement, including but not limited to the scope of Work, plans, schedules, or specifications, shall be invalid unless approved in writing by an authorized representative of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. In the event of any such change, the Parties shall mutually agree in writing to any corresponding fee changes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of avoiding delays and/or addressing emergencies, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may make changes to the Work before the Parties agree to such changes in writing, in which case Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s reasonable estimate as to the value of any additional Work shall be deemed accepted by Customer.</p>

    <h2>6. Scheduling/Delays/Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Customer shall be responsible for promptly scheduling all appointments for Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. to perform the Work. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not responsible for missed or delayed inspections, service, or other Work, due to Customer’s failure to promptly schedule. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate Customer’s preferred schedule, but Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. has no obligation to provide the Work within a particular time frame. Any completion dates in the Order Document or otherwise provided by Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. are estimates, not definite completion dates, and time is not of the essence. In the event the Work is delayed, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall have such additional time for performance as reasonably necessary under the circumstances. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may assess a fee if Customer cancels an appointment less than 24-hours prior to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s deployment of personnel to the Facility, or if the Work is re-scheduled or delayed by Customer or others engaged by Customer, through no fault of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. Customer shall reimburse Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for any increased costs or damages that Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. incurs due to Work that is rescheduled or delayed through no fault of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall not be responsible for failure to provide the Work due to causes beyond its control, including but not limited to work stoppages, labor troubles, acts of civil or military authorities, fuel or other material shortages, fires, or acts of God.</p>

    <h2>7. Hazardous Conditions</h2>
    <p>Customer shall notify Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. in writing of any hazardous conditions or substances that Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may encounter during the performance of the Work (including but not limited to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not obligated to perform Work in an area where it determines hazardous conditions or substances exist until the Customer has made the area safe to the satisfaction of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. If Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. determines that continuing the Work poses a risk to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. or its employees or agents, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may elect to terminate the Agreement for cause upon written notice to Customer. Customer is solely responsible for the testing, removal, storage, remediation, and disposal of any hazardous conditions or materials in accordance with applicable law. To the extent hazardous waste will be generated in connection with the Work, Customer shall sign any and all hazardous waste manifests as the generator of such waste under applicable laws. Under no circumstances shall Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. have any obligations with respect to such hazardous conditions or materials or any liability for damages or costs associated therewith, including but not limited to remediation and cleanup costs. Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., its officers, directors, agents, employees, affiliates, successors and partners (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against expenses, costs, claims, demands, losses, damages, actions, fines, penalties, or liability of any kind, whether actual or alleged, including but not limited to actual damages, damages for bodily injury or property damage, consequential or indirect damages, remediation and cleanup related costs, and any attorneys’ fees and expert costs, arising out of or related to hazardous conditions or hazardous substances at the Facilities, whether or not the Customer notifies Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. of their existence.</p>

    <h2>8. Warranties</h2>
    <h3>8.1. General</h3>
    <p>Except for the express warranties in the Agreement, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to any warranty of merchantability, warranty of fitness for a particular purpose its suitability or effectiveness as designed, installed, and/or utilized, or that it will operate as designed, intended, or expected. Such waiver includes any representations or warranties stated on Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s website or other sales or advertising materials, and Customer agrees not to rely on these materials for this purpose. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. does not represent or warrant that the Covered System or Work cannot be compromised or circumvented, or that it will always provide the protection for which it was installed.</p>

    <h3>8.2. Limited Equipment Warranty</h3>
    <p>If any component of the Covered Systems sold and installed by Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. becomes defective within 90 days from the date of installation, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall provide all labor, materials, and parts necessary to replace or repair the defective component at no cost to Customer, subject to the terms and exclusions set forth below. In addition, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. will pass through to Customer any applicable manufacturers’ warranties, to the extent permitted. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. only warrants replacement parts for the remainder of the warranty period.</p>

    <h3>8.3. Maintenance Plans</h3>
    <p>If Customer purchases a Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. maintenance plan (“Maintenance Plan”), Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall, during the Maintenance Plan Term, provide all labor, materials, and parts necessary to replace or repair defective components of the Covered System, as further described in the Order Document and subject to the terms below.</p>

    <h3>8.4. Warranty Conditions and Exclusions</h3>
    <p>All warranty services will be provided during Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s normal business hours and days, as determined by Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. Warranty services outside of these times will be subject to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s then current rates for labor and materials. In fulfilling its warranty obligations, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. has sole discretion as to whether to replace or repair the defective components, whether to substitute components for components of equal or better quality, and/or to use reconditioned components. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, the following are excluded from any Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. warranty services (i) batteries, wiring, LCDs, screens, cleaning, reconfiguration, realignment, software upgrades or repairs, communication devices that are no longer supported by communication pathways, obsolete components, and components exceeding manufacturer’s useful life; (ii) defects resulting from accident, misuse, tampering, abuse, attempted or unauthorized repair, service, or modification by anyone other than Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.; (iii) defects resulting from electrical surges, insects, pests, water damage, lightning, or other acts of God; and (iv) defects resulting from lack of proper maintenance or Customer’s failure to follow operating instructions. If Customer requests warranty services, and upon inspection Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. determines that such service is not covered by the warranty, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may charge Customer for a service call whether or not Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s representative actually worked on the Covered System, and, if Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. chooses to perform the out of warranty service, it shall do so at Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s then current rates.</p>

    <h2>9. Liability and Disputes</h2>
    <h3>9.1. Not An Insurer</h3>
    <p>Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’S SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE CERTAIN RISKS AND LOSS, BUT Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT NO LIABILITY, LOSSES, CLAIMS, OR DAMAGES (COLLECTIVELY “LOSSES”) WILL OCCUR. Customer acknowledges and understands that (i) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not an insurer of or against Losses to person or property, whether direct, incidental or consequential, that may occur in connection with the Work or Covered Systems; (ii) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. does not provide insurance coverage to Customer under the Agreement; (iii) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s fee for the Work provided is unrelated to the value of Customer’s real or personal property; and (iv) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. cannot and does not guarantee that any Work or Covered Systems will work as intended. Customer shall maintain appropriate insurance coverage for liability, casualty, fire, theft, and property damage, under which Customer is named as insured and Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is named as additional insured, and which shall cover any loss or damage the Covered Systems are intended to protect against or detect to its full insurable value. Customer will look to its own insurance carrier for any Losses resulting from the Agreement and shall release Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. from any Losses which are recovered or recoverable by Customer from insurance coverage or for which Customer is indemnified. Customer waives any right to subrogation that it or its insurers have against Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. Customer agrees to obtain any endorsement that may be necessary to affect this waiver of subrogation, but this provision applies regardless of whether or not Customer has received a waiver of subrogation endorsement from its insurer.</p>

    <h3>9.2. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO (i) FAILURE OF ANY COVERED SYSTEM IN ANY RESPECT WHATSOEVER, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY ACTS OF GOD, THEFT, DESTRUCTION, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS; (ii) CUSTOMER’S ACTS OR OMISSIONS; (iii) THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD-PARTIES NOT ACTING ON Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’S BEHALF; OR (iv) ANY FAILURE, DEFECT, VULNERABILITY, OR OTHER PROBLEM ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACILITIES. SHOULD THERE ARISE ANY LIABILITY ON THE PART OF Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHER CAUSE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (i) $250 AND (ii) THE FEES PAID TO Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. BY CUSTOMER FOR THE WORK GIVING RISE TO THE APPLICABLE LOSS DURING THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO SUCH LOSS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, REVENUE OR OPPORTUNITY, OR FOR ANY OTHER LIQUIDATED, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE. Customer may, through a supplemental agreement, obtain a higher limit by paying an annual payment consonant with Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s increased liability. This higher limit shall not be construed as insurance coverage. The Parties agree that there are no third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement. If the limitations of liability in the section are not enforceable under applicable law, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

    <h3>9.3. Contractual Limitation Period</h3>
    <p>Customer expressly agrees that any claim, lawsuit, or cause of action, whether in contract, tort or other legal theory, that it may have relating to the Agreement, must be filed within one year from the date on which the alleged Losses occur; provided, however, if the foregoing restriction is not enforceable under applicable law, Customer must file within two years from the date on which the alleged Losses occur. Customer expressly waives any statutory and/or common law limitation period to the contrary. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any claim related to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s failure to perform under the Agreement, Customer must provide Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. with a written, detailed description of the claim, within ten business days after such claim arises. Customer acknowledges and agrees that failure to timely send such detailed written notice shall be deemed a waiver of such claim. Customer acknowledges that these restrictions may limit Customer’s ability to bring a claim within the statutory and/or common law statute of limitation.</p>

    <h3>9.4. Indemnification</h3>
    <p>Customer acknowledges that the Agreement is intended for its sole benefit. Therefore, Customer shall indemnify, defend (if required by Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.), and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against expenses, costs, claims, demands, losses, damages, actions, fines, penalties, or liability of any kind, including legal, defense, and investigation costs, whether actual or alleged, arising out of or related to the Work or the Agreement, except if caused solely by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. If such obligations are not enforceable under applicable law, Customer agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless to the maximum extent permitted.</p>

    <h3>9.5. Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>The Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to such state’s conflict of laws rules. Any action shall be brought and resolved by the state and federal courts located in the state in which the Work is provided and the courts to which an appeal therefrom may be taken. Each Party consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives all questions of jurisdiction and venue. Either Party may file a copy of this section with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary, and bargained Agreement between the Parties irrevocably to waive any objections to venue or to convenience of forum. The Parties waive trial by jury in any action between them, unless prohibited by law. CUSTOMER MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION PLAINTIFF OR CLASS ACTION MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES OR ARISING OUT OF THE AGREEMENT SHALL, AT THE OPTION OF Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., BE DETERMINED BY ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR ADMINISTERED BY ARBITRATION SERVICES INC., UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, EXCEPT THAT NO PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES MAY BE AWARDED. The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of the Agreement and is authorized to conduct proceedings by telephone, video, submission of papers or in-person hearing. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS AGREEING TO WAIVE ITS RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, TO APPEAL AN ARBITRATION AWARD, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

    <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>During the Term and for two years thereafter, neither Party shall use the other Party’s Confidential Information for purposes other than the performance of its obligations under the Agreement. Each Party shall protect the other Party’s Confidential Information by using the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own information of a like nature, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party shall only disclose the Confidential Information to those who have a need to know such Confidential Information in order to perform its obligations under the Agreement. "Confidential Information" shall mean information not generally available to the public that either is marked as confidential or a reasonable person would consider confidential and that is provided to the receiving party or which the receiving party has access to or discovers in the performance of the Agreement, whether in oral, tangible, electronic or other form. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing Party. Each Party will provide reasonable prior notice to the other, unless prohibited by applicable law, if it is required to disclose any of the other party's Confidential Information under operation of law, and such disclosure shall not constitute a breach of the Agreement.</p>

    <h2>11. Non-Solicitation</h2>
    <p>Customer acknowledges and agrees that the employees of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. who perform the Work are a valuable asset to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. and are difficult to replace. Accordingly, Customer agrees that, for a period of one year after expiration or termination of the Agreement, it will not, directly or indirectly, solicit, hire or otherwise employ any employee or agent of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. who performed such Work. If Customer violates this section, Customer will pay to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. damages equal to 100% of that individual’s total compensation in the preceding twelve months of employment with Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. For purposes of the Agreement only, an “individual’s” annual salary shall mean the individual’s annual salary with either Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. or with Customer, as of the date of Customer’s violation of this section, whichever is greater.</p>

    <h2>12. Severability, Integration, and Assignment</h2>

Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. shall provide the Monitoring Services for the Term set forth in the Order Document, which shall not begin until the Covered System is fully installed and operational, the necessary communications connection is completed and tested, and Customer provides the Call List described below; however, billing for such Monitoring Services shall begin as soon as Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. receives signals from the Covered Systems. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may, without prior notice, suspend or terminate the Monitoring Services, if (i) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. determines that there is a threat of civil unrest, natural disaster, or other condition that renders monitoring or response impractical; (ii) the Customer breaches the Agreement; (iii) the monitoring center or communication network is nonoperational; (iv) or the Covered System is sending excessive false alarms or runaway signals.</p>

    <h3>7.1. Notification Procedure</h3>
    <p>Upon receipt of an alarm or other event notification signal transmitted from the Covered System (each a “Signal”), Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. or its designee monitoring center shall take commercially reasonable measures to notify the Customer and/or the appropriate emergency service provider, as set forth in the Agreement, the Call List described below, and as otherwise required by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Signal is monitored by a Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. designee monitoring center, such monitoring center shall be subject to the same rights and obligations in this section as if it was Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.. Before the Monitoring Services begin, Customer shall provide Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. with notification instructions and a written list of the names, titles, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of those individuals that the Customer chooses to be notified in the event of a Signal (the “Call List”). Customer is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information on the Call List and for providing Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. with written notice of any necessary changes. Customer represents that the individuals listed on the Call List are authorized to act on the Customer’s behalf and Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is authorized to rely on their instructions. Unless otherwise provided in the Call List, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. will make a commercially reasonable effort to contact the first person reached or notified on the list either by telephone call, text message, in-app message or email message. No more than one attempt to contact each individual shall be required and any form of notification provided for herein, including text messages or leaving a message on an answering machine, shall be deemed reasonable compliance with Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc.’s notification obligation. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may use automated calling devices to deliver such notification. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not responsible if none of the contacts can be reached using the information on the Call List, nor is it responsible for finding alternative contacts or contact information. In addition to notifying the Customer in accordance with the Call List, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may also notify emergency service providers or other interested parties, but it is not required to do so unless required by law. Some Signals are transmitted from Customers’ premises directly to emergency service providers and are not monitored by Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. or its designee monitoring center. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not responsible for the manner in which the emergency service providers monitor these systems, or their response to such signals, if any.</p>

    <h3>7.2. Non-Emergency and False Signals</h3>
    <p>Not all Signals require notification. For example, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not required to take action on Signals unless the associated codes were previously identified to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. in writing, nor is it required to take action on signals related to the loss of a communication pathway or low battery signal. Furthermore, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may choose to implement measures designed to reduce the occurrence of false alarms, which in some cases may be required by applicable law, the authority having jurisdiction, emergency service providers, or other impacted parties. For example, upon receiving a Signal, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may, in its sole discretion, choose to first attempt to contact the Facility to verify that the Signal is not a false alarm, before providing the necessary notification. The Customer acknowledges that these measures may prevent or delay Signal notification, verification procedures, and/or response. IF Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. HAS REASON TO BELIEVE, IN ITS OR THEIR SOLE DISCRETION, THAT NO EMERGENCY CONDITION EXISTS, IT MAY ELECT NOT TO FOLLOW THE NOTIFICATION OR OTHER VERIFICATION PROCEDURES UTILIZED FOR EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. Customer is fully responsible and liable for any fines, costs, expenses or penalties resulting from the Covered Systems being activated for any reason whatsoever, including for false alarms and runaway signals, and shall reimburse Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for any costs it incurs in connection therewith. In addition, Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may also charge a service fee if Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. personnel are deployed to the Customer location in response to a service call or Signal caused by Customer error. If the Covered System has a local audible device, Customer authorizes Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. to enter the premises and turn off the audible device, for which Customer will be charged a service fee.</p>

    <h3>7.3. Audio and Video</h3>
    <p>If the Monitoring Services include audio and/or video verification of a Signal, the monitoring center shall monitor video or sound for as long as it deems appropriate to verify an alarm or emergency condition. Customer authorizes and consents to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. listening to such audio and watching such video and releases Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. for all losses, damages and expenses due to Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. listening-in to the Facility. Customer acknowledges the inherent limitations associated with visual and audio verification, including (i) inadequate illumination of viewing area; (ii) physical obstructions in the field of view of the video camera; (iii) inadequate receipt, clarity, placement or quality of the images and (iv) uncertainty regarding the source of the audio content. Customer is solely responsible for (i) the placement, direction and presence of audio and/or video equipment; (ii) transmission, transfer or other use of any images, audio or other data captured by the equipment; (iii) the manner of use of the equipment or data captured by the equipment; and (iv) complying with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and ordinances in connection with the use and operation of the equipment.</p>

    <h3>7.4. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Customer acknowledges that (i) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. does not supervise the Covered System; (ii) the Covered System communicates with the monitoring facility over one or more transmission systems, as determined by the Customer in its sole discretion, such as plain old telephone systems (POTS), DSL, broadband, internet, VOIP, radio, and cellular; (iii) these transmission systems and the communication networks through which they pass, are maintained and serviced by the applicable transmission system provider and are wholly beyond the control of Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc., except Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may own the radio network; (iv) these transmission systems may be interrupted, circumvented, or compromised by natural or human causes, including ground interference, atmospheric conditions, weather conditions, power outages, system upgrade or maintenance, and the cutting of telephone lines, in which case the Signal may not be appropriately transmitted and received; (v) the Signal may also not be appropriately transmitted or received if the communication equipment is incompatible, inoperative, or interrupted; and (vi) Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. may not be aware of the existence of any such problems. Customer is responsible for testing the system on a weekly basis, as well as immediately following any storm, power outage, transmission system outage, or any change to any transmission system, in order to verify the continued functioning of the system. Customer shall immediately notify Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. of any problems with the Covered System. Customer understands that no form of monitoring is error-free, nor can it provide complete protection or guarantee prevention of loss or injury. Fire, floods, crimes, medical problems, or other incidents, are unpredictable and cannot always be detected or prevented. Customer also acknowledges that Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. does not have control over the response times of emergency service personnel. Therefore Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not responsible for any failure which prevents Signals from successfully reaching the appropriate monitoring center, or for damages arising therefrom, or data corruption, theft or harm to Customer’s computers connected to the Covered System. Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. is not required to supply Monitoring Services during any period of interruption. Customer acknowledges that line security devices and/or alternative transmission systems may be purchased, but it has declined to do so, unless expressly indicated. Customer further acknowledges that, during periods in which Tri-Star Alarm Services Inc. or its designee monitoring center receives a larger than normal level of Signals from its various customers, such as during a storm or power outage, the notification of such signals may be prioritized and notification for lower priority signals may be delayed.</p>
